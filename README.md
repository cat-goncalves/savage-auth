## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Microsoft Passport

This project uses Node.js and the Express.js framework to create a full-stack CRUD message board  application that allows the user to upvote, downvote and delete posts. This app also uses Microsoft Passport for account creation and login authentication to access the message board


## Lessons Learned:
Working on this app was an opportunity to continue to practice the skill of creating CRUD full stack apps. This project uses Microsoft Passport login authentication to create and authenticate user logins. In addition, this app uses multiple routes, as the user is navigating between distinct pages on the website.
